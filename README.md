Compilation
-----------

We use maven to handle our dependencies and build, so you need the Java JDK and Maven for compiling the sourcecode.

* Download & install [Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)
* Download & install [Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
* Check out this repository (clone or download).
* Navigate to the project folder of this repository which contains a `pom.xml` and run:

        mvn clean install

Builds
------

* EventBridge is built by a [Jenkins job](http://ci.quartercode.com/job/EventBridge/) on the QuarterCode Jenkins instance.
* Finished builds can be downloaded from the [QuarterCode DL website](http://quartercode.com/dl/projects/details?projectId=EventBridge).
* Builds are also available on the [QuarterCode maven repository](http://repo.quartercode.com).
